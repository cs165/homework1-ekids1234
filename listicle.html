        Italian soda at Bytes
      </p>

      <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/EjneHBEPksw">350 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA</a>

      <p class="paragraph">
        When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a
        non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit
        syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated water. The Italian
        sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee
        shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

      <p class="recommand">
        <b>Recommendation</b>: Raspberry Italian soda

      Bubble tea at Pop Tea Bar
    </p>

    <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3jHRC2umZCy">456 Cambridge Ave, Palo Alto, CA</a>

    <p class="paragraph">
      When your boba craving strikes, head over to Pop Tea Bar, a cute little bubble tea shop on Cambridge Avenue. The menu
      is your standard bubble tea fare with nothing too adventurous on the menu -- no bubble tea floats, for example -- but
      the tapioca is fresh, the service is fast, and the tea is smooth and delicious! They have little bites to eat too, like
      popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in perfect snack-size portions. There's not too much seating, but there's a cute outdoor
      area in the back for warmer days.
      
      Pop Tea Bar isn't exactly on campus, but the Marguerite has got you covered. Ride the 1050A to California and El Camino
      and it's a short walk from there. (11 minutes total from the Gates Computer Science Building!)

    </p>
    <p class="recommand">
      <b>Recommendation</b>: Classic Milk Tea with tapioca + an order of popcorn chicken.
